### Goals

When expanding Kint, keep in mind its main priorities:

1. **Ease of use**: developers must be able to install Kint effortlessly and start using it immediately with no additional required steps. JS/CSS resources and the phar file should be rebuilt with `composer build` and committed when changed.
2. **No feature creep**: requests for edge use cases, especially ones that can be worked around with some configuration, should *not* be catered to. The definition of edge case is the popularity of the feature request, if it's popular - it's a workflow, if not - it might be an edge case.
3. **Do not compromise information clarity**: displaying relevant information is the entire purpose of Kint. Try to ensure your output is as clear as possible.
4. **Code quality**: the nature of Kint implies that it will be continued to develop for many years - at least to adapt to new language features and quirks. Keep the codebase as maintainable as possible. Keep code style and quality consistent by finishing every commit with `composer format`, and `composer analyze`.
5. **Stable releases**: Try not to push backwards compatibility breaking or untested changes to the master branch. A new branch will be created for upcoming major version upgrades.
6. **Don't alter user input**: For the parser to do proper recursion checking it has to take things by reference. Since it's taking things by reference there's a good chance your parser plugin can change your end-users data. **NEVER ALTER INPUT VARIABLES**

### Development instructions

```sh
composer install # Install dependencies
composer build   # Build JS/CSS resources, and the final phar file
```

Note: Full format and build depends on `npm` being in your `$PATH`.
